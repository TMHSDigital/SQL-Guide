# SQL Syntax

SQL syntax defines the rules for writing SQL statements. These statements are used to perform various operations on a database. Here are some key components of SQL syntax:

## Basic SQL Statements

- **SELECT**: Retrieve data from a database.
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;

INSERT
The INSERT statement is used to add new data to a database.

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);

**Operators**
  *Comparison Operators*
  =: Equal to
  <>: Not equal to
  >: Greater than
  <: Less than
  >=: Greater than or equal to
  <=: Less than or equal to
>
*Logical Operators*
  AND: Combines multiple conditions; all conditions must be true.
  OR: Combines multiple conditions; at least one condition must be true.
  NOT: Negates a condition.
>
*Arithmetic Operators*
  +: Addition
  -: Subtraction
  *: Multiplication
  /: Division
  %: Modulus
>
**Functions**
>
*Aggregate Functions*
  COUNT(): Returns the number of rows that match a specified condition.
  SUM(): Returns the total sum of a numeric column.
  AVG(): Returns the average value of a numeric column.
  MIN(): Returns the smallest value of a column.
  MAX(): Returns the largest value of a column.
>
String Functions
  CONCAT(): Concatenates two or more strings.
  LENGTH(): Returns the length of a string.
  SUBSTRING(): Extracts a substring from a string.
>
Date Functions
  NOW(): Returns the current date and time.
  CURDATE(): Returns the current date.
  DATEDIFF(): Returns the difference in days between two dates.
>
Example Query
Here's an example of a complex query that combines several of these elements:
SELECT name, age
FROM users
WHERE age > 25
ORDER BY age DESC;

In this query:

SELECT name, age retrieves the name and age columns from the users table.
FROM users specifies the table to retrieve the data from.
WHERE age > 25 filters the results to include only users older than 25.
ORDER BY age DESC sorts the results by age in descending order.
Understanding SQL syntax is crucial for writing effective SQL queries that can interact with the database in the desired manner.
