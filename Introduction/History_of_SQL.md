# History of SQL

SQL was developed in the early 1970s by IBM researchers Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin. It was originally called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) before being renamed SQL.

## Key Milestones

- **1970**: Edgar F. Codd, an IBM researcher, introduced the concept of relational databases in his seminal paper "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks."
- **1974**: SQL was developed by IBM as part of their System R project to implement Codd's relational model.
- **1979**: Relational Software, Inc. (now Oracle Corporation) released the first commercial implementation of SQL, Oracle V2.
- **1986**: The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) adopted SQL as the standard language for relational database management systems (RDBMS).
- **1989**: ISO adopted the ANSI SQL standard, making it an international standard.
- **1990s-Present**: SQL has continued to evolve with new standards and features, including support for XML, JSON, and procedural programming extensions.

## Evolution of SQL Standards

- **SQL-86**: The first SQL standard published by ANSI.
- **SQL-89**: Minor revision with various clarifications and enhancements.
- **SQL-92**: Major revision introducing significant features like integrity constraints and improved set operations.
- **SQL:1999**: Added support for object-oriented features and recursive queries.
- **SQL:2003**: Introduced XML-related features and window functions.
- **SQL:2006**: Enhanced XML features.
- **SQL:2008**: Added support for triggers, new data types, and performance improvements.
- **SQL:2011**: Included temporal databases support.
- **SQL:2016**: Added JSON support.
- **SQL:2019**: Introduced more enhancements for big data and analytics.

SQL has proven to be a powerful and flexible language for database management, maintaining its relevance over decades of technological advancements.
