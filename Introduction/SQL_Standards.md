# SQL Standards

SQL standards are established by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to ensure consistency and interoperability across different database systems.

## Major SQL Standards

- **SQL-86**: The first SQL standard, establishing basic syntax and functionality.
- **SQL-89**: Provided minor revisions and clarifications to SQL-86.
- **SQL-92**: A significant update that added more complex features and expanded the language.
- **SQL:1999**: Introduced object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) features and recursive queries.
- **SQL:2003**: Included support for XML, window functions, and standardized sequences.
- **SQL:2006**: Enhanced XML capabilities within SQL.
- **SQL:2008**: Added new data types, the MERGE statement, and improved procedural capabilities.
- **SQL:2011**: Introduced temporal data support, allowing for the management of historical data.
- **SQL:2016**: Added support for JSON data and improvements for real-time analytics.
- **SQL:2019**: Focused on big data and analytics enhancements.

## Importance of SQL Standards

- **Interoperability**: Ensures that SQL code can be used across different database management systems with minimal modification.
- **Consistency**: Provides a consistent framework for database development and management.
- **Innovation**: Standards evolve to incorporate new technologies and methodologies, keeping SQL relevant.

## Compliance and Extensions

While most database systems comply with SQL standards, they often include proprietary extensions to enhance functionality and performance. Common examples include:

- **MySQL**: Offers unique features like storage engines and specific functions.
- **PostgreSQL**: Known for its advanced features and compliance with many SQL standards.
- **SQL Server**: Includes T-SQL, Microsoft's proprietary extension to SQL.
- **Oracle**: Uses PL/SQL, Oracle's procedural language extension to SQL.

Understanding SQL standards helps in writing portable and robust SQL code, ensuring compatibility across different database platforms.
